      <h3>Will I be using IELTS or TOEFL?</h3>
      <p>

        official language tests, however, It is rather necessary to fulfil the

      <h3>Does it provide for living cost?</h3>

      <h2>📌 Closing Remarks</h2>

      <p>
        One can’t emphasize enough the difficulty to secure a Loughborough
        Global Impact Scholarship due to the limited number of awards given
        which is usually in the range of 20-25 and demands proof of highest
        record of performance and contribution. Thus having a record of
        sufficient evidence supporting position attainment, accompanying
        motivation letters would greatly improve the prospects of getting the
        scholarship.
